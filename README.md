### A DYI WiFi hydrometer

A simple, ESP8266 + MPU6050 based hydrometer. The basic working principle is
that a tilting cylinder in a liquid. The tilt changes with buoyancy and hence
liquid density (which is related to the alcohol content when the liquid is
fermenting beer).

In order to derive a relationship between tilt angle and specific gravity of 
the beer, a calibration procedure is performed.
